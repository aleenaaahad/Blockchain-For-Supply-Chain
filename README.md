# Blockchain-Based Supply Chain Tracker

This is a small-scale decentralized application that allows users to add Products to the blockchain using blockchain technology.

## What This Project Does

Users can:
- Add a product with an ID and inventory level
- View product information stored securely on the blockchain

All of this is handled through a simple user interface that connects to a smart contract deployed on a local blockchain network.

## Why This Project Is Relevant

In real-world supply chains, product data is often stored in centralized databases. This can lead to problems like:
- Data manipulation
- Lack of transparency
- Difficulty verifying records
  
## Requirements
To run this project locally, you’ll need the following tools installed:

- **Node.js , npm and nvm** – Required to run the frontend and install dependencies
- **Hardhat** – A development framework to compile, test, and deploy smart contracts on a local blockchain
- **MetaMask** – A browser extension that acts as a crypto wallet and connects the frontend to the blockchain

## Note

This is a small-scale demo intended for local development and demonstration purposes. It uses basic blockchain features and can be expanded with additional functionality such as shipment tracking, QR code integration, and role-based access in future versions.
